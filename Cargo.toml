# WARNING: DO _NOT_ USE THIS FEATURE IF YOU ARE WORKING ON CONSENSUS CODE!*
#
# Provides implementations for more data structures than just Vec and Box.
# Concretely it will provide parity-codec implementations for many types
# that can be found in std and/or alloc (nightly).
#
# This feature was mainly introduced after it became clear that pDSL requires
# it for the sake of usability of its users.
#
# * For rational about this please visit:
