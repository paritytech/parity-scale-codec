error[E0599]: the function or associated item `max_encoded_len` exists for struct `Generic<NotMel>`, but its trait bounds were not satisfied
  --> tests/max_encoded_len_ui/not_mel.rs:12:29

   | function or associated item `max_encoded_len` not found for this

   |                                ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ function or associated item cannot be called on `Generic<NotMel>` due to unsatisfied trait bounds
   |
note: the following trait bounds were not satisfied because of the requirements of the implementation of `MaxEncodedLen` for `_`:
      `NotMel: MaxEncodedLen`

7  | struct Generic<T> {
   |        ^^^^^^^^^^
note: the following trait must be implemented
  --> src/max_encoded_len.rs
   |
   | / pub trait MaxEncodedLen: Encode {
   | |     /// Upper bound, in bytes, of the maximum encoded size of this item.
   | |     fn max_encoded_len() -> usize;

   = help: items from traits can only be used if the trait is implemented and in scope
   = note: the following trait defines an item `max_encoded_len`, perhaps you need to implement it:
           candidate #1: `MaxEncodedLen`
   = note: this error originates in the derive macro `MaxEncodedLen` (in Nightly builds, run with -Z macro-backtrace for more info)
